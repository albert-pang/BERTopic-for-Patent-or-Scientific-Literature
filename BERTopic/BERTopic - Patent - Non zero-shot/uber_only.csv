Allows simpler design of LiDAR sensors that are easier and less expensive to build since only one lens is used for directing transmitted rays onto the target and receiving reflected optical rays. Eliminates the need to precisely align the laser emitter and detector behind the lens. Improves reliability since small displacements of the double clad fiber relative to the lens, caused by vibration or temperature change, will not result in a loss of alignment between the laser emitter and detector. Avoids the misalignment problem that might occur when the LiDAR sensor is exposed to vibrations and shock as the multi-clad fiber moves as one part, since optical path that uses multi-clad fiber has a single channel for both the emitter and detector. | The drawing shows a schematic diagram of the optical apparatus for LiDAR sensing system. 1Light source5Multi-clad optical fiber6Optical directing device15Inner cladding16Core17Target surface62Optical apparatus",
